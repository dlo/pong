Pong
====

This is my first game ever.

Building
--------

Before you compile, make sure you have the GLEW libraries. To build it, just run

    make pong

I've only run this on OSX Snow Leopard, so I have no idea how / if it will build on other platforms.

Gameplay
--------

Top player moves left / right with the 'a' and 'd' keys, respectively, while the bottom player moves with the arrow keys. If the ball breaks through your paddle, the other player gets a point. The game ends whenever you want it to end :).
